# Experiment 1-2: Feature Selection (SelectFromModel)

## Results
- **Accuracy:** 0.67  
- **ROC AUC:** 0.747  

## Comparison with Baseline (Exp1-1)
| Experiment | Accuracy | ROC AUC |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Exp1-1 (Baseline) | 0.68 | 0.77 |
| Exp1-2 (Feature Selection) | 0.67 | 0.75 |

## Interpretation
- Accuracy is almost unchanged after feature selection.  
- ROC AUC decreased slightly (0.77 â†’ 0.75), but predictive power remains strong.  
- This suggests that reducing features maintains performance while improving interpretability.
