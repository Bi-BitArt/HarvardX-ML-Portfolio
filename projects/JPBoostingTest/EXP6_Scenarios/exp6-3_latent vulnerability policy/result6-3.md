### Exp6-3: Latent Vulnerability Policy (LVP) vs. Income-based Targeting

#### Setup
We mianly compare two policy rules under external shock:

1. **Uniform Cash (Universal ¥100,000)** — Japan 2020 Policy, all households receive ¥100,000.
   
2. **Cluster-based Policy (LVP)** — A **Latent Vulnerability–oriented** redistribution scheme that operates under a **budget-neutral constraint** equivalent to the universal transfer.  
Unlike linear or income-based targeting, LVP allocates resources **non-linearly** according to a composite *vulnerability score* derived from both economic and structural indicators.

In practice, households are first clustered by **income and savings capacity**, identifying those with low financial buffers.  
Within the most vulnerable cluster, a weighted index — combining **income, savings, debt-to-income ratio, financial literacy, and digital access** — determines the relative need of each household.  
The total budget (identical to the universal ¥100,000-per-household baseline) is then **redistributed disproportionately** to those with higher latent vulnerability scores, creating a *nonlinear transfer curve* that intensifies support for structurally fragile groups without increasing overall expenditure.

This design embodies a **budget-neutral yet need-sensitive** policy logic: rather than “equal cash for all,” it translates the same fiscal capacity into a **multi-dimensional fairness mechanism**, aligning redistribution with hidden socioeconomic fragilities.

#### Step 1: Clustering Households
Households were clustered by **annual income** and **savings rate** (3 clusters).

- **Cluster 1 (orange):** low income × low savings — identified as the most vulnerable group.  
- Other clusters: relatively higher income and/or savings, less exposed to immediate shock.

#### Step 2: Feature Differences in Vulnerable Cluster
We compared feature averages of Cluster 1 against the overall sample.

### Key differences

- **Lower annual income and limited savings capacity**, indicating structural poverty and weak financial buffers.  
- **Higher share of foreign-born household heads**, reflecting potential barriers in labour markets and social networks.  
- **Lower educational attainment of household heads**, often translating into lower financial literacy and unstable employment.  
- **Lower financial literacy**, limiting the ability to plan, save, and respond effectively to shocks.  
- **Higher proportion of multigenerational households**, signalling reliance on informal support systems amid structural vulnerability.  

These dimensions reveal **latent vulnerabilities** beyond income or savings alone.  
They show how financial fragility intertwines with **education, social position, and household structure**, shaping resilience to future shocks.

#### Step 3: Transition Matrices
Policy impacts were evaluated using class transition matrices.

#### Step 4: ROC AUC Metrics
| Scenario                     | ROC AUC | Δ AUC   |
|------------------------------|---------|---------|
| Baseline (pre-shock)         | 0.911   | 0.000   |
| Shock (no policy)            | 0.872   | −0.039  |
| Uniform Cash (Universal)　　　| 0.881   | −0.030  |
| Cluster-based Policy (LVP)   | 0.865   | −0.046  |

#### Key Findings

- **Universal Cash Transfer:**  
  - The decline in predictive accuracy was minimal (ΔAUC −0.030).  
  - Both Class 3 and Class 4 showed only about **10% mild improvement**, indicating that the policy did **not effectively reach the most vulnerable groups**.  
  - However, the overall transition across classes demonstrated **systemic stability**, suggesting that equal distribution mitigated volatility.  

- **Cluster-based Policy (LVP):**  
  - Compared with the universal policy, predictive accuracy declined moderately (ΔAUC −0.046, about 1.5× larger).  
  - Despite using the **same total budget** as the universal transfer, LVP achieved **by far the most substantial improvements** among all four policies.  
  - In particular:  
    - **54% of Class 4 households improved**, with **35% moving to Class 2** and **19% to Class 3**.  
    - **54% of Class 3 households moved up to Class 2**, meaning that LVP successfully improved conditions for **over half of the vulnerable segment**.  
    - Even **15% of Class 1 households improved to Class 0**, showing that its effectiveness extended **beyond the most vulnerable groups**.

#### Insights

- **Observed Trade-off:**  
  - Income-based targeting maintains moderate predictability but overlooks latent vulnerabilities.  
  - LVP protects vulnerable households more strongly, but at the **cost of a larger reduction in predictive accuracy (ROC AUC)**.  

- **Why Latent Vulnerability Matters:**  
  - Income alone underestimates risk — households with “average” income may still face hidden fragility due to **low financial literacy, high debt burdens, or limited digital access**.  
  - These structural factors explain why some “seemingly stable” households fall rapidly into distress after economic shocks.  
  - LVP identifies and responds to these **previously invisible forms of vulnerability**, channeling resources precisely to where support is most needed.  


- **Implications:**  
  - The Latent Vulnerability Policy (LVP) demonstrates the **cost of fairness** —  
    while it rescues borderline households through multidimensional support,  
    it intentionally sacrifices model discriminability as inequality decreases.  
  - Sustainable policy must therefore combine **structural improvements** (e.g., literacy, digital access, debt reduction) with **financial transfers** for lasting resilience.  
  - Evaluation metrics should shift from asking *“How well does the model predict?”* to *“How effectively does the policy reduce structural fragility?”*.

> **In essence, LVP reframes redistribution not as charity, but as a data-informed structural correction mechanism.**
