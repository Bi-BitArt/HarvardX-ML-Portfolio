### Note on Reproducibility (Experiments 6-1 to 6-3)

- To ensure **efficient and fully reproducible** policy-simulation results, the multi-class vulnerability dataset  
**`household_vulnerability_japan_multiclass5_bins03_07_noise.csv`**  
has been **directly included** in this `/exp6_Scenarios` directory. 

- This ensures that all experiments in Section 6 can be **reproduced immediately and consistently**.
