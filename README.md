# HarvardX CS109: Machine Learning and AI with Python

This repository contains my coursework, notes, and implementations from the HarvardX course *"Machine Learning and AI with Python"*.  
It is structured by section, following the course organization on edX.

## Purpose

This portfolio is part of my preparation for applying to postgraduate programs in 2025.  
It demonstrates my understanding of core machine learning algorithms and Python-based implementation skills.

# Highlight: Projects

While the course sections (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, etc.) show my step-by-step learning,  
the **[projects/](projects/)** folder contains the most important part of this portfolio:  
my **independent experiments and applications** of machine learning methods beyond the course itself.  

If you are reviewing this repository, **start with the projects folder!**  
It demonstrates how I extended the course knowledge into original research-style work, such as:  
- [JPBoostingTest](projects/JPBoostingTest) – synthetic household vulnerability prediction inspired by  
  *Salvador (2024): "Use of Boosting Algorithms in Household-Level Poverty Measurement:  
  A Machine Learning Approach to Predict and Classify Household Wealth Quintiles in the Philippines"*
