# HarvardX CS109: Machine Learning and AI with Python

ðŸ”Ž **For admissions reviewers**  
Please start with the [projects](projects/) folder.  
It contains my independent experiments beyond the HarvardX coursework.  
- [JPBoostingTest](projects/JPBoostingTest) â€“ synthetic household vulnerability prediction inspired by  
  *Salvador (2024): "Use of Boosting Algorithms in Household-Level Poverty Measurement"*  

## Purpose
This portfolio is part of my preparation for applying to postgraduate programs in 2025.  
It demonstrates my understanding of core machine learning algorithms and Python-based implementation skills.  

This repository also contains my step-by-step learning from the HarvardX course *"Machine Learning and AI with Python"*.  
It is structured by section (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, etc.).

## Contents

- [section01_decision_trees_I/](section01_decision_trees_I/) â€“ Decision Trees I  
- [section02_decision_trees_II/](section02_decision_trees_II/) â€“ Decision Trees II  
- [section03_bagging/](section03_bagging/) â€“ Bagging  
- [section04_random_forest/](section04_random_forest/) â€“ Introduction to Random Forest  
- [section05_boosting/](section05_boosting/) â€“ Boosting
