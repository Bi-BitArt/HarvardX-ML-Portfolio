## Preparation knowledge

- **Regression**

Decision trees are often utilized for classification tasks. However, they can also serve as a tool for regression - that is, **predicting** a quantitative outcome.

(At first, I imagined regression as "going back" through the decision tree,  
like using feature parameters to trace the identity of something.  
But I realized that regression still works by going forward - 
the tree uses those parameters to split the input space and reach a numerical output at the end.)

### What is classification?

Classification is the task of predicting a categorical label (class) based on input features.  
One of the most basic classification models is **logistic regression**, which calculates the probability of belonging to a particular class.
