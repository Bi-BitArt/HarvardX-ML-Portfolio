 Section 1: Decision Trees I

## Preface
- **Exponential notation**: For instance, the number 8,000,000 (eight million) can be expressed as `8e6` or `8 * 10^6` or `8 Ã— 10^6`.

## Topics Covered
- What is a decision tree?
  A decision tree is a ML algorithm, that can be used for both classification and regression. It's one of supervised algorithms, characterized by a treelike structure, where internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch represents a decision, and each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction.

- What is a decision tree?  
  A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences as a tree-like structure, where:
  - Each internal node represents a "test" on a feature (e.g., is income > $50K?),
  - Each branch represents the outcome of that test,
  - Each leaf node represents a final decision or prediction (e.g., class label).
