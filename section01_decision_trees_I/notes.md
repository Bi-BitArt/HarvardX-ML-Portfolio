 Section 1: Decision Trees I

## Preface
- **Exponential notation**: For instance, the number 8,000,000 (eight million) can be expressed as `8e6` or `8 * 10^6` or `8 Ã— 10^6`.

## Topics Covered

  It is one of the supervised algorithms, characterized by a tree-like structure, where:

  - Each internal node represents a feature or attribute.
  - Each branch represents a decision.
  - Each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction.
