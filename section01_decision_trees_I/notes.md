 Section 1: Decision Trees I

## Preface
- **Exponential notation**: For instance, the number 8,000,000 (eight million) can be expressed as `8e6` or `8 * 10^6` or `8 Ã— 10^6`.

## Topics Covered

- What is a decision tree?

  A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression.  
  It is one of the supervised algorithms, characterized by a tree-like structure, where:

  - Each internal node represents a feature or attribute.
  - Each branch represents a decision.
  - Each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction.

- What is a classification?

  For example, the simplest and most straightforward classification model we know is **logistic regression**.

- When **logistic regression** works best?

  Under the condition that the classes are well separated in the feature space.
