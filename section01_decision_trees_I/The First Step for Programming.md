### The First Step for Programming

This document is not just a summary of the first steps in programming with Python, but also a **reminder note**.
Whenever I get stuck during exercises, I may come back here and quickly review the essential imports and their roles.


### Sheet1: Load election train dataset (loading data)

- import () as []
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn as sk
import seaborn as sns

These codes works to import libraries and label them.

### Sheet2: Split train and test datasets (trainâ€“test split)
---
### Sheet3: Split predictors and response variables (specifying features X and target Y)
---
### Sheet4: Initialize and fit decision trees (depth = 2, 10)
---
### Sheet5: Plot decision boundaries of classifiers (visualizing model boundaries)
---
### Sheet6: Train decision trees with multiple predictors (depth = 2, 10, 15)
---
### Sheet7: Compute train and test accuracy (evaluating models)
---
### Sheet8: Display results as table (comparing accuracy scores)
