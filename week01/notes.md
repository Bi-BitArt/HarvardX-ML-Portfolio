# Week 1: Search Algorithms

## Topics Covered
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search Algorithm

## Key Concepts
- A* uses the cost function: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
- Choosing an effective heuristic h(n) is crucial for performance.

## Reflections
This week helped me understand how AI systems evaluate options in a structured space.
It made me think about how decision processes can be optimized under constraintsâ€”something I hope to explore in my graduate research on household financial behavior.
